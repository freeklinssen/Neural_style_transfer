# Neural Style Transfer
Two different algorithms to achieve Style Transfers. 

The results of the feed-forward approach are not showed in GitHub as the Notebook is too long but can be viewed through Google Colab instead. The feed-forward model performs better than the original approach and is able to tweak the intensity of the styles and mix them. 
The weight of the feed forward model are not included since the file was too large for GitHub.
